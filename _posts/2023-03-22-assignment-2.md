 ## The heatmap of 'LARCENY/THEFT' in San Francisco
In the following heatmap of 'LARCENY/THEFT' in San Francisco San, it becomes apparent that certain areas of the city are more prone to crime than others. The heatmap shows the spatial distribution of crime incidents throughout the city, with each district represented by a different color based on the frequency of crimes.
What's particularly striking about it, is the large concetration of crime incidents in the northeastern part of the city. Despite the fact that the districts shown in this area are smaller than those in other parts of the city, the frequency of the crimes in this region is more than double that of many other areas. A possible reason is that these districts are close to the bridge that leads to Oakland and criminals can easily escape after commiting a crime.
This pattern raises important questions about the underlying factors that contribute to crime in this part of the city, and what can be done to address them.
